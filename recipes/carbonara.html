        <p><em><strong>Spaghetti alla carbonara.</strong></em> 
        Luscious and wonderfully indulgent, pasta carbonara takes
        as long to makes as it does to cook the pasta.
        The ingredients are simple -- just spaghetti
        (or another long pasta), and the carbonara
        is made with pancetta or bacon, eggs, Parmesan,
        a little olive oil, salt, and pepper!</p>

        <!-- List of ingredients-->
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 oz. guanciale, pancetta, or bacon</li>
            <li>2 oz. Parmesan</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 larage egg yolks</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps on how to make carbonara -->
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 6 qt. water in a large pot over high. 
            When water starts to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt 
            and cover pot with a lid 
            (this will bring water to a boil faster).</li>
            <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little 
            prep. Remove 4 oz. guanciale from packaging and cut 
            into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate 2 oz. cheese 
            and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later</li>
            <li>Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium 
            bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining 
            grated cheese. Add several cranks of pepper and 
            set aside.</li>
            <li>Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large 
            Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add 
            guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp 
            around the edges, 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish 
            out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat 
            into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 
            3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>
            <li>Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring 
            occasionally, 2 minutes shy of package instructions. 
            Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta 
            cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch 
            oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain 
            pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, 
            until al dente and water is reduced by about half, 
            about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>
            <li>Whisk ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid into reserved 
            egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, 
            stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is 
            thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, 
            if needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta 
            cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until 
            it's the consistency of heavy cream</li>
            <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. 
            Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
        </ol>
